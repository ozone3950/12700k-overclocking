# 12700K Overclocking

## Introduction

The 12700K is an amazing chip - £360 or so with amazing gaming performance and productivity for the price at the high end bracket. 8P cores, accompanied by 4E cores which I will likely be disabling.

In this repo, I will be CPU and memory overclocking, and testing on different coolers, since I am planning to custom loop in the future. The results will also be on my [HWBOT profile](https://hwbot.org/user/ozone_3950/).


## The Setup

- i7-12700K
- MSI PRO Z690-A DDR4
- Team Group Dark Pro 2x8GB 3200c14-14-14-31 1.35v

This board is one of the only Z690 boards worth buying, since most of them either have issues, are overpriced, or both. The board isn't too expensive, with also having sufficient VRMs to OC the CPU, and MSI currently has the best memory overclocking among their boards.

This memory is a well-binned B-die kit, which should be able to OC well. I managed to get it for £50 on eBay, which is significantly cheaper than it usually costs.
